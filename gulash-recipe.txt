Ingredients

* 2 tbsp Olive oil
* 700g stewing steak, cut into chunks
* 30g plain flour
* 1 large Onion, thinly sliced
* 2 clove Garlic, finely chopped
* 1 green pepper, deseeded and thinly sliced
* 1 red pepper, deseeded and thinly sliced
* 2 tbsp tomato puree
* 2 tbsp Paprika
* 2 large Tomatoes, diced
* 75ml dry White wine
* 300ml beef stock, home-made or shop-bought
* 2 tbsp flat leaf Parsley, chopped
* black pepper
* 150ml Soured cream

Method

Preheat the oven to 170C/gas 3.
Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a casserole dish or heavy-based saucepan.
Sprinkle the steak with the flour and brown well, in batches, in the hot casserole dish. Set the browned meat aside.
Add in the remaining olive oil. Add in the onion, garlic, green pepper and red pepper to the casserole dish and fry until softened, around 5 minutes.
Return the beef to the pan with the tomato puree and paprika. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.
Add in the tomatoes, white wine and beef stock. Cover and bake in the oven for 1 hour 30 minutes. Alternatively, cover and cook it on the hob on a gentle heat for about an hour, removing the lid after 45 minutes.
Sprinkle over the parsley and season well with salt and freshly ground pepper. Stir in the soured cream and serve.
